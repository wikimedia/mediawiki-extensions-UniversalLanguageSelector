== Universal Language Selector ==
The Universal Language Selector extension (ULS) provides a flexible way to
configure and deliver language settings like interface language, fonts, and
input methods (keyboard mappings). This will allow users to type text in
different languages not directly supported by their keyboard, read content in a
script for which fonts are not available locally, or customise the language in
which menus are displayed.
